With
you
I
feel
so
very
fine
Babe
believe
me
love's
no
crime
How
I
wish
you
could
be
mine
I
want
to
be
your
Valentine
Darling
our
love
is
simply
divine
Let's
go
somewhere
nice
to
dine
Would
you
come
over
for
a
glass
of
wine
You
are
my
little
porcupine
I
hope
to
see
you
again
some
time
When
I
saw
you
for
the
very
first
time

Oh
how
I
longed
to
make
you
mine
I
fell
in
love
'cause
you
looked
so
fine
I
love
you
more
than
words
can
say
I
love
you
more
and
more
each
day
I
think
of
you
each
night
and
day
Before
I
met
you
my
days
were
gray
Baby
quick
kiss
me
and
tell
me
you
will
stay
If
you
go
out
with
me
I
will
pay
Oh
Darling
please
don't
go
away
Our
love
will
never
fade
away
With
you
by
my
side
I
can't
go
astray
I
would
like
to
kiss
you
if
I
may
You
are
the
sunshine
of
my
life
I
wish
we
could
be
husband
and
wife
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
all
my
life
In
the
sea
of
love
with
you
I
would
dive
Come
over
to
my
place
after
five
Without
your
love
I
can't
survive
I
want
children
with
you
but
not
more
than
five
You
make
me
feel
so
much
alive
To
get
to
you
a
thousand
miles
I
would
drive
I
want
you
dead
or
alive
Your
eyes
they
are
like
stars
so
bright
You
keep
me
awake
at
night
Let's
go
to
the
cinema
a
restaurant
tonight
You
are
sweet
and
funny
and
always
right
You
are
my
beacon
in
the
dark
of
the
night
I
am
thinking
of
you
day
and
night
Please
come
closer
I
won't
bite
We
could
sit
together
by
candle
light
Kiss
me
quick
and
hold
me
tight
I
want
to
be
your
Jedi
Knight
I
am
Amidala
and
you're
my
Jedi
Knight
You
are
the
cutest
one
of
all
If
I
had
your
number
every
day
I
would
call
Your
love
hit
me
like
a
cannon
ball
I
can't
think
of
anything
else
at
all
I
am
desperately
waiting
for
your
call
I
will
surely
love
you
until
fall
When
we
talk
I
can
tell
you
all
Open
your
heart
you
can
tell
me
all
Don't
keep
me
waiting
until
fall
I
really
have
a
crush
on
you
I
have
a
major
crush
on
you
I
can't
resist
your
charmesâ€”it's
true
For
a
long
time
I've
been
watching
you
For
so
long
I've
been
wanting
you
I
am
head
over
heals
in
love
with
you
Tell
me
quick
Do
you
love
me
too
I
am
totally
crazy
about
you
If
you
were
in
love
with
me
too

If
you
said
I
love
you
too;

I
would
kiss
you
till
our
lips
are
blue
I
would
jump
for
joy
like
a
kangaroo
My
heart
is
in
your
hands
I
believe
in
happy
ends
I
am
the
greatest
of
your
fans
Tell
me
Do
I
have
a
chance
I
know
a
nice
place
where
we
can
dance
Babe
please
give
our
love
a
chance
Please
don't
say
Let's
just
be
friends
We
are
more
than
just
good
friends
You
have
the
cards
in
your
own
hands
Without
you
my
life
doesn't
make
sense
I
love
you
I've
no
other
chance
You're
the
most
beautiful
girl
handsome
guy
under
the
sun
Girl
Boy
you
are
my
number
one
Make
up
your
mind
or
I
will
be
gone
Of
all
the
moments
we've
had
I
regret
none
Come
on
Baby
let's
have
some
fun
You
are
not
the
only
one
I
love
you
like
I've
never
loved
anyone
I
am
under
your
spell
what
have
you
done
For
me
you
are
the
only
one
Being
with
you
is
so
much
fun
